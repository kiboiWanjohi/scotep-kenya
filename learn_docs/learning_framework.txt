3-Day Mammogram Cancer Detection Model Plan:

Day 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing
- Collect and organize mammogram dataset
- Preprocess images: resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets

Day 2: Model Architecture and Training
- Design CNN architecture for mammogram classification
- Implement the model using Keras
- Train the model on the prepared dataset
- Monitor training progress and adjust hyperparameters

Day 3: Model Evaluation and Refinement
- Evaluate model performance on the test set
- Analyze results using appropriate metrics (e.g., ROC curve, AUC)
- Refine the model: try different architectures or transfer learning
- Document findings and prepare for dissertation presentation
